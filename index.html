        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello! My name is Richard Elphinstone. 
            Around 2017, I began to dive into an interest of developing a video 
            game with the game engine Unity. From there, I fell into a rabbit 
            hole and found a passion in software development. I started researching 
            and practicing with online tutorials, which increased my desire to 
            advance my education. Now, using credits from my previous associate degree, 
            I will be proudly receiving my bachelor's degree from Southern New 
            Hampshire University in November 2022 with a concentration in coding.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have thoroughly enjoyed starting to use 
            my skills in development of projects such as the python text adventure 
            game Spooky Street, as well as the C++ dice game simulation of Left Center 
            Right. My family has also encouraged me in fun ways. My daughter has asked 
            me to create a website to host her gallery of her future famous artwork. 
            Currently, I am learning more about Software Development Life Cycle through 
            SNHU. Additionally, I am completing the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Career 
            Path. With this course, I plan to expand my skills with JavaScript, additional 
            tools, and frameworks. I consider myself lucky to find a career that I am 
            consistently excited to learn more about, and look forward to creating more. 
        </p>
