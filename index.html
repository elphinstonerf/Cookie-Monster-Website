        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Richard Elphinstone. Around 2018, I began to dive into an interest of develop a video game with the game engine Unity.
            From there I fell into a rabbit hole and found a passion in software development. I started researching and practicing with online
            tutorials, which turned into my desire to aquire a more education. Now, using credits from my previous Associate's degree, I will be
            proudly graduating Southern New Hampshire University in Novemeber 2022 with a concentration in program languages. I have througrouhly
            enjoyed beginning to use my skills in development of projects such as the python text adventure game Spooky Street, as well as the c++
            dice game simulation of Left Center Right. My family has also incouraged me in fun ways. My daughter has asked me to create a website 
            to host her gallery of her future famous artwork. While updating this site and her site regualary, I have another Java project I am 
            starting which will feature (Enter Stuff Here). I consider myself lucky to find a career that I can constantly learn more about and 
            look forward to creating and learning more. Let's see what we can build together!
