        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello! My name is Richard Elphinstone. Around 2017, I began to dive into an 
            interest of developing a video game with the game engine Unity. From there I fell into a rabbit hole and 
            found a passion in software development. I started researching and practicing with online tutorials, which 
            turned into my desire to aquire a more education. Now, using credits from my previous Associate's degree, 
            I will be proudly graduating Southern New Hampshire University in Novemeber 2022 with a concentration in 
            program languages. I have througrouhly enjoyed beginning to use my skills in development of projects such 
            as the python text adventure game Spooky Street, as well as the c++ dice game simulation of Left Center Right. 
            My family has also incouraged me in fun ways. My daughter has asked me to create a website to host her gallery 
            of her future famous artwork. While updating this site and her site regualary, I am currently learning more about
            Software Development Life Cycle through Southern New Hampshire University. Additionally I am completing the 
            Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Career Path. With this course I am hoping to expand my skills with JavaScript. 
            I consider myself lucky to find a career that I am consistantly excited to learn more about and look forward to 
            creating more. Let's see what we can build together!
