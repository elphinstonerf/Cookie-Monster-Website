        <h2>Not just work experience...LIFE Experience</h2>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Below you will find not only work history, but also personal experiences. 
            I have been lucky to have expereinced a number of adventures in life. One 
            very important thing I have learned is the amazing results we can achieve 
            by simply saying "yes I will try" and then doing my best. By living these 
            experiences, I have gained knowledge and skills that I continue to use to 
            further my personal skills and explore the world around us.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Fun</h3>
            <p>There are a number of extra activities I enjoy. One is my interest in aviation. I have a number of logged 
                Pilot in Command hours that I hope to one day acquire my Private Pilot License. Another hobby is playing 
                paintball. With a high amount of physical endurance and tactical skills, I always have a blast playing with
                family and friends. Finally is just being outdoors in general. I enjoy going camping and hiking with the occasional
                white water rafting trip during the summer months and some snow boarding during the winter when I can.</p>
